            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>There is further conſiderable. 1.</hi> Amongſt <hi>Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds,</hi> that thoſe that bring forth animals have <hi>haires,</hi> and the oviperous have ſhells: horſes have moſt haire upon the mane, lions upon their ſhoulders, conies upon the corners of the mouth and leggs, and the hare is moſt villous; in all, they grow thick in old age, and gray in the horſe; hogs and porcupines have briſtles, the ſheep is covered with woole, and the goat is bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The <hi>skinne,</hi> in the ſea horſe is ſo thick, that ſpeares may be made thereof; and in the elephant and rhinoceros, it is almoſt impenitrable. The <hi>hornes,</hi> in the ſtagge are ramous, ſimple in the ſpitter, palmate in others, ramous and little in roes, not ſheeding, turning round in rammes, dangerous in bulls, bending backwards in the rock-goat, adverſe in the damae, erect contort and ſharp in the ſtrepſiceros, the Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian have moveable hornes, the Troglodyte direct to the earth; alſo ſome have robuſt for butting, others for wounding, ſome aduncate, others reduucate, others for toſſing are ſupine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or connext: and all are mucronate. The <hi>eares,</hi> are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and all have them, at leaſt all that bring forth ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and ſome have great eares, others have little; they are divided as it were in the hart, and pilous in the rat; in horſes, and labouring beaſts they ſhew their ſpirits, being emarcid in thoſe that are weary, micant in the fearfull, ſomewhat erect in the furious, and looſed in the ſick. The <hi>mouth,</hi> is large in the lion, and dog, and as it were rent, in thoſe that live by hunting, and meane in ſwine. The <hi>trunk,</hi> is onely in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. The <hi>jawes,</hi> are long in working cattle, and round in apes. The <hi>neck</hi> is ſtiffe in the lion, woolfe and hyena. The <hi>duggs</hi> are two, in thoſe that have two young ones, and ſolid hoofes, and thoſe betwixt the thighs, ſo in biſulcs and thoſe that are cornigerous: cowes have foure teats, and ſheep and
<pb facs="tcp:170401:10"/>
goates two thoſe that have a numerous breed, &amp; are digitate, have more along the belly, in a double order, as ſwine; the beſt <hi>12,</hi> the vulgar <hi>10,</hi> ſo bitches: ſome have <hi>4</hi> in the middle of the belly, as panthers: others two, as lioneſſes, the elephant hath two under the ſhoulder: none have them between the thighs, that have toes. The <hi>toes,</hi> of thoſe that live by prey, are five in the forefeet, and foure in the reſt; but lions, woolfs, dogs, and a few others, have five in the other alſo, one hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down neer the joint of the legge; the reſt, which are leſſe, have five. The <hi>nailes</hi> are in all that have toes; but the ape's are imbricate, thoſe of the rapacious aduncate: in others they are ſtraight; as in doggs, except that which for the moſt part depends on the legge. The <hi>hooſes,</hi> are ſolid in thoſe, that are not cornigerous: and thoſe that are horned, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly biſulks, the jllyrick ſwine in ſome places have ſolid, and they are renewed only in the veterine. The <hi>taile</hi> is in all, except apes, and in thoſe that have eggs according to the body: they are bareiſh in thoſe that are rough, as boares; little in the ſhagged, as beares ſetoſe in thoſe that are longiſh, as horſes; and being cut off, they grow again in lizards, it's very long in kine, and rough at the bottome, in horſes the dock is ſhorter than in aſſes, but ſetoſe in the veterine; in the lion it's like the cowe's at the bottome, &amp;c. but not ſo in panthers: it's buſhey in foxes and woolfs, as alſo in ſheep. Alſo in the <hi>internall parts,</hi> there is a diverſity. The <hi>teeth,</hi> are exerted in the boar, ſerrate in the dogge and lion; contiguous in the horſe and cow, the foremoſt acute, and the interiour plaine. The cornigerous have but one row: they are exert in none, in which they are ſerrate they are not exert or ſerrate in any that are horned: but concavous in all, &amp; ſolid in the reſt, and in the ape as in man; in thoſe that are ruminant, the lion and the dog, they are changed in ſwine they never fall out. The <hi>tongue,</hi> in croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, doth all adhere: in lions and cats, it's of an imbricate aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:170401:10"/>
and like a file: and broad chiefely in the elephant. The <hi>ribbes,</hi> are <hi>10</hi> in ſwine, and <hi>13</hi> in thoſe that are horned. The <hi>heart,</hi> in all, is in the midle of the breaſt; in that of horſes, kine, and ſtaggs, there are bones. it's greateſt in proportion, in mice, hares, aſſes, ſtaggs, hyaena's, and all that are malefick by reaſon of feare. The <hi>lungs,</hi> in the tortiſe are without bloud: and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in proportion in the chamaeleon, and nothing elſe within. The <hi>belly,</hi> in ſolipedes is rough and hard: in others that are terreſtriall, of a denticulate aſperity, and in ſome mordaceous cancellate. The <hi>ſpleen,</hi> is round in biſulks, and thoſe that are cornigerous: prolix in the multifid; &amp; very long in ſolipedes. The <hi>reines</hi> are in all that generate animals; &amp; only in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe amongſt the oviperous. The <hi>bladder,</hi> is in none of the oviparous, except the tortiſe: and in none that want ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous lungs, or feet. The <hi>fat,</hi> is often in the horned, having teeth in one part, and huckle bones in the feet, theſe have tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; biſulks, or the cloven footed, and without hornes, grow fat, and this when cold is fragile, and ever in the extremity of the fleſh; but the fat between the fleſh and the skin, is ſucculent and liquid: ſome grow not fat: but all thoſe that are more ſterill, are fat. The <hi>marrow,</hi> is red in the young, and whitiſh in the old: it's only in hollow bones, and not the leggs of labouring beaſts, and dogs: it's fat in thoſe that are fat, and ſevous in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigerous: bares have none, &amp; the lions little in their thigh bones &amp; fore leggs. As for the <hi>place,</hi> for the moſt part it's the land; but ſome live in the water, as the crocodile, ſea-horſe, beaver, and ſea tortiſe; ſome in denns, others in trees; ſome in a hot climate, others in a cold; and in Africa, there are no boares, ſtaggs, nor goats. The <hi>diet</hi> alſo is not alike, cowes, ſtaggs, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſwine, feeding upon herbs and fruits; ſheep, low, goats high, upon bowes and ſprouts; woolfs, lions, and dogs upon fleſh; the beaver, and cat, delighting in fiſhes; and the chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon in flies; ſome chew the cud, others not, the ape and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
<pb facs="tcp:170401:11"/>
eate any thing, and the beare is ſaid to lie hid in winter, and to live by ſucking the moiſture, which is then in their ſwollen forefeet. The <hi>generation</hi> is diverſe alſo, but moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerate in autumne, ſummer or ſpring, and bears and bulls with ferocity, but doggs without it: for the moſt part, they bring forth live young ones, but the tortiſe crocodile and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard have eggs, and cowes have their young only in the right ſinus of the womb. The <hi>geſtation</hi> is various alſo, the woolf goeth a month or forty daies, the bitch nine weeks: the ſow <hi>4</hi> months, the goat <hi>5.</hi> ſheep <hi>6,</hi> cow <hi>10,</hi> and mare <hi>11.</hi> The <hi>number</hi> of their young differeth likewiſe, the mule is ſaid never to breed, the woolf but once, &amp; the hare is often troubled with ſuperfetation. The <hi>bigneſſe</hi> is differing, ſolipeds and biſulcs uſually being greater than the digitate. And the magnitude differs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the place. torteiſes being of an hundred pound weight in Taprobana, and lizards <hi>8</hi> cubits long in Aethiopia. The <hi>life,</hi> in ſome is ſhort, in others long. hares and cats live ſeven yeares; rams and goats ſeldome above ten; hogs twenty, and dogs ſometimes; the exe ſeldome above <hi>16,</hi> horſes <hi>35,</hi> mares till <hi>40</hi> or <hi>50,</hi> or as <hi>Pliny,</hi> till <hi>70</hi> or upwards; the mule <hi>80,</hi> &amp; ſtags an <hi>100.</hi> The <hi>ſight</hi> is moſt acute in the lynx and dorcas; hyaenas and cats ſee in the night; moles, very little or not at all. The <hi>hearing</hi> is moſt exact in the hare. The <hi>ſmell</hi> is beſt in the dog, and ſo weak in ſwine that they are not offended with dung. The <hi>taſte</hi> is exacteſt in the ape. The <hi>inward ſenſes</hi> are very dull in the bugill, which having hid his head, thinks the whole body covered: others are more ſubtil; apes are full of imitation: the fox tries the thickneſſe of the ice he is to paſſe over, by laying his eare to it: dogs remember the waies beſt, and are not excelled by any but onely man: ſtaggs hearing the dogs bark, run down the wind, that their ſent may not betray them: and moſt beaſts know what remedies are beſt for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes: the panther ſeeks mans dung, the tortiſe ſtrengthens
<pb facs="tcp:170401:11"/>
himſelfe againſt ſerpents, by eating the herb called cunila, and the weaſel uſeth rue. The <hi>love</hi> of apes is ſuch towards their young, that they often kill them by hugging them. The <hi>luſt</hi> of ſwine is ſuch, that then they will wound ſuch as ſtand in their way, the bull is moſt impetuous, but the camel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders only in the covert. The <hi>motion</hi> alſo, is differing; ſome being ſwift, others ſlow, and the hare ſwifteſt, the elke will goe as farre in one day as the horſe in three, but the aſſe is exceeding ſlow. The <hi>voice</hi> in horſes is called neighing, lowing in bulls, braying in aſſes, grunting in ſwine, roaring in lions, houling in woolfes, barking in dogs, yelping in foxes, and croaking in frogs, &amp;c. The <hi>uſe</hi> likewiſe is various, thoſe that are hairie yeelding milk, others fleſh; ſome, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that of the dogge, cat, and horſe &amp;c. is known, and the uſe of their ſeverall parts follow.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Amongſt <hi>Birds.</hi> The <hi>neck</hi> and parts towards the earth, are common with thoſe of other animals: and <hi>wings, feathers</hi> and <hi>bill</hi> are proper; but they want lips, teeth, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles, and noſtrils, yet have little holes inſtead thereof. The <hi>eyes,</hi> are as thoſe of other creatures, two in number, but without lids; but they winke, a membrane paſſing from the angle. The <hi>thigh</hi> is like the <hi>hip,</hi> long, reaching to the middle of the belly, fixed to it. The <hi>hip</hi> is large in thoſe that have crooked clawes, and the <hi>breaſt</hi> is ſtronger than in others. The <hi>taile</hi> is ſupplied by a rump, it's ſhort in thoſe that have long leggs, or whole feet, but long in others. They bend the wings forewards. The <hi>leggs</hi> are two, as in man, but they bend them backwards as quadrupedes, they are long in thoſe that have claws, and live in the water: yet the manuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diats want them: they all have diverſe clawes, and in ſome meaſure divided; thoſe which flie high have all foure toes, three in the forepart, and one backwards, in ſtead of a heele;
<pb facs="tcp:170401:12"/>
a few have two forewards, and ſo backwards, and ſome have ſpurs, but not the crooked clawed. The <hi>comb,</hi> is in the cock, yet ſome have feathers inſtead thereof. The <hi>inward parts</hi> are differing alſo. The <hi>tongue</hi> is found in all, in ſome long, in others broad, which may be taught to counterfeit ſpeaking; in ſome it is hard and ſharpe like horne, and fleſhie backwards. The <hi>throat ſtopper</hi> is in none, yet they tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the motion ſo, that nothing may fall into the throat. The <hi>bowels</hi> are diverſe, in ſome the craw lying before the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The <hi>ventricle</hi> in very many is carnoſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, having a very ſtrong skin within. The <hi>craw</hi> being wanting, the gullet is broad and large where it's joyned to the ventricle, as in jack-dawes, crowes, and quailes; and thoſe that want it, have a long one, and their excrements are more liquid, as the porphyrio. The <hi>inteſtine</hi> in ſome is ſmall, and ſingle. The <hi>appendices</hi> are explicate, but few, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, as in fiſhes, but in the lower part, at the extremities of the inteſtines. The <hi>gall</hi> in ſome is in the belly, in others in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, as in the ſwallow, and pigeon, &amp;c. The <hi>teſticles,</hi> are joyned to the reines, and in ſome are little and obſcure, and in the time of coiture they are greater. The <hi>ſperme</hi> is white. The <hi>bladder</hi> is wanting, a great quantity of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity being required to the nouriſhment of feathers. The <hi>place,</hi> is the aire, water, or earth, &amp; ſome abide not in the ſome region, the ſwallow tarrying but halfe a yeare, the thruſh and turtle three months, others depart after breeding, as houps, and ſome live in hidden places. The <hi>meat,</hi> is fleſh, inſects, herbs, grains, ſeeds, fiſhes and frogs: of theſe, ſome drink by ſucking, as thoſe that have long necks, with intermiſſion, and reſupination of the head and the porphyrio by biting. The <hi>generation</hi> is by the lying down of the female, as in hens; or ſtanding, in cranes: in ſome at any time, as in hens: and they breed at any time, except in the two brum all months of winter; but for the moſt

Thoſe that have aduncat clawes are infecund, and their prey more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: of their eggs, ſome are white, as thoſe of henns and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges: others, pale, as of the aquatick; others ſpotted, as the turkie's; ſome red, as the pheaſant's; and within they are all of two colours; the young when hatched, paſſe out by the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part, the ſhell being ſoft, but preſently waxing hard: the time of ſitting and number hatched is various, ſometimes onely the hen ſitteth, ſometimes only the male: amongſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons the cock in the day, and hen in the night: amongſt ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doves, the henne from noone till morning, and the cock the reſt; after coiture they quiver, and ſtretch, themſelves; amongſt theſe there is ſympathie; and antipathie, as betwixt the ſwan and eagle, crow and kite, and ſo as to beaſts. The <hi>motion,</hi> is various, ſome walking, as crowes, ſparrowes and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds leaping, partridges and woodcocks running, ſtorks and cranes throwing their legs forewards, kites ſtretching their wings, and ſeldome ſhaking them; others, oftener, but only their feathers, the crow ſtretching the whole ſide, hick-ways for the moſt part cloſe, linnets moving the wings once or twice, ſwallowes flying high, low, directly, partridges low, larks high &amp; falling, quailes leaping, ducks upright at firſt &amp; high; vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and thoſe of heavy bodies, flying from ſome high place, and being ruled by the taile; ſome looking about, others ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the neck many making a noiſe when they fly, others being ſilent, ſome flying ſtraightiſh, others pronely, obliquely, ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and others reſupinate; thoſe that have long legs fly hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them backwards; if ſhort, they hold them contracted: thoſe that have crooked clawes uſually fly high, except the nocturnall. The <hi>voice</hi> is moſt frequent in thoſe that are ſmall, and chiefely when about generation, ſome make a noiſe
<pb facs="tcp:170401:13"/>
in fighting, as quailes; others before it, ſc. partridges, and cocks, after it; and amongſt ſome, the cocks have one note and the hen another. ſome ſing all the yeare, others at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times: the noiſe in ringdoves is the ſame in all, the bird taurus imitates the lowing of cattle, and anthus the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of horſes. The <hi>life,</hi> is various amongſt them, the male ſparrow not living much above one yeare, pigeons and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles eight, &amp; quailes &amp; crowes many. Their <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> is known by their feathers, and they are ſubject unto many. Their <hi>divination</hi> is known, cranes foretelling faire weather by their ſilence, and tempeſts by their noiſe; ſo herons, crying at break of day, faire weather is expected when the owle hooteth at night, the crow and quaile making a noiſe in the evening portend foule weather, and ſwallowes flying up and down about waters. Their <hi>uſe,</hi> is for meat, medicine, and ſport &amp;c. and their fleſh is light, wholeſome, and well digeſted. Their <hi>difference,</hi> is according to their parts, ſo ſome have ſtraight bills, ſome crooked; ſome long legs, others ſhort; ſome have toes, others whole feet, others without: ſome are criſtate or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, others not: ſome have long necks, as cranes, others ſhort: their wings uſually are proportionable, except in the dodo which is covered with doune, and for the moſt part all have tailes: they are great or little, terreſtriall, marine, lakiſh, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, domeſtick, wild, feelden, or ſolitarie; their colours are diverſe, ſo their meat, and frequency of generation. The voice in nightingals is called ſinging, croking in crowes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in partridges, gagleing in geeſe, groaning in pigeons and turtles, crowing in cocks, chackling and clucking in henns, crunkling in cranes, quacking in ducks, cherping in ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, chattering in pies, and hooting in owles, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:170401:13"/>3. Amongſt <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> The <hi>Cartilagineous,</hi> are plaine or long: the leſſer of them are above a cubit in length, and their <hi>ſpine</hi> is cartilagineous, their <hi>gills</hi> are detect, their <hi>finnes</hi> are double, and five on each ſide, they have <hi>egges</hi> all like birds; their place is various. The <hi>heart</hi> is pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonous, and gall placed in the liver in the galeus. The <hi>womb</hi> hath ſinus's, and thoſe placed under the ſeptum of the midriffe, as birds. Some have their <hi>mouth</hi> upwards, or in the extreame, and cannot take the prey, without reſupination. They <hi>live</hi> in the deep ſea, and when they bring forth, they goe to the foords &amp; ſhores. Their <hi>meat</hi> is fiſhes. Some of them <hi>generate</hi> averſly; the plaine that have tailes, copulate being ſupine upon the backs of the females, and they have <hi>egges</hi> in the ſuperiour part: and hate the forkfiſh. The <hi>Raie</hi> hath a long and rough taile, the <hi>eye</hi> is covered with a nebula: the <hi>genital</hi> is like that of the ſea-calſe. Their <hi>place</hi> is in dirty places not farre from the ſhore. They <hi>generate</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of their ſupine parts, and beget egges, and bring forth animals. The <hi>Pſettaceous,</hi> or plain and <hi>ſpinoſe,</hi> have a <hi>ſpine</hi> that ſeemeth to be divided in the midd'ſt. Their <hi>finns</hi> are foure, two in the prone part, two in the ſupine, &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallate round. Their <hi>gills</hi> are foure, on each ſide. The <hi>tongue</hi> is wanting. The <hi>eyes</hi> are in the ſupine part of their heads. Their <hi>jawes</hi> are rugous and rough, and ſerve inſtead of teeth. Their <hi>Throat</hi> is ſomewhat like a craw, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the ventricle. Their <hi>mouth</hi> is little in reſpect of their bodies. The <hi>heart</hi> is gibbous in one part thereof. The <hi>liver</hi> is broad, and embraceth the ventricle. The <hi>gall</hi> is in the extreme part thereof. The <hi>ſpleen</hi> is black; ſituated under the ventricle, which is broad. Their <hi>place</hi> is the ſea, and muddie rivers. Their <hi>meate</hi> is of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats and ſhell-fiſhes. They <hi>breed</hi> once in a year: &amp; they <hi>ſwim</hi> tranſeverſly. They take their <hi>prey,</hi> by hiding themſelves in

the mudde and putting out their virgulae, and ſo alluring the ſmall fiſhes, comming to them as weeds. The <hi>Cetaceous,</hi> have lungs, arterie and neck, and other members common with the terrene quadrupedes. Their <hi>skin</hi> is extraordinary thick. Their <hi>lungs</hi> ſerve to coole their great heat: therefore they want gills; but have fiſtules. Their <hi>mouth</hi> is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that the fiſhes might eſcape, when they are reſupina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>teeth</hi> are wanting in ſome, others are toothed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them broad forewards, and ſharp backwards. The <hi>teats</hi> in the female yeeld much milk. Their <hi>fat</hi> increaſeth much, they eating fiſhes, and moving ſlowly. The <hi>internall parts,</hi> under the peritonaeum, which are made for nutrition and generation, are more like thoſe of terreſtriall quadrupeds, than of fiſhes: for the <hi>epiploon</hi> is leſſe fat in them, the <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle</hi> is great. The <hi>pancreas</hi> is joyned to the fundus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and it paſſeth to the <hi>inteſtines,</hi> which have many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The <hi>meſentery</hi> is joyned to the vertebra's, having black glandules, veines and arteries interwoven. The <hi>reines</hi> are ſituated betwixt the liver and teſticles. The <hi>urine</hi> is percolated through the ureters into the bladder, which is like that of terreſtriall animals, and in the inferiour part of the belly, and it is retained by the ſphincter. To the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachus</hi> the umbilicall arteries are joyned. The <hi>teſticles</hi> are on each ſide, longiſh, having preparant veſſels, ſc. many ramuli of veines and arteries ariſing from the great veine, which after many turnings are inſerted into the epididymis.

Their <hi>place</hi> is the ſea onely, yet not in all, and in the deep; they are ſeen chiefely about the ſolſtices, and are at other times in the bottome of the water.

The <hi>male</hi> hath the prone parts of the body more black than the ſupine, and all parts more rough than the female, various by intervening lines, and the taile ſharper. They <hi>copulate</hi> long, and the females have egges, at firſt undivided, afterwards ſeperated, and then increaſe, after they have received a vitall ſtrength from the ſperme of the male ſhed thereon, and that after the manner of wormes.

Their <hi>age</hi> is long, yet none of them breath, but they are refrigerated by caſting out water with their fiſtula. Their <hi>ſight</hi> is dull, but <hi>ſmell</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi> well, they <hi>ſleep</hi> like other aquatiles, they are without <hi>voice,</hi> goe obliquely, and <hi>ſwim</hi> onely with the taile. they lie hid in the winter, and are fat in ſpring and autumne. they <hi>fight</hi> with the hornes, and caſt their ſhels after breeding.

The male is known by two white particles in the fleſh of the breaſt, and the female hath egges annexed to the belly: they <hi>copulate</hi> like quadrupedes that piſſe backwards, in the ſpring time, neere the earth.

thoſe moſt uſed in diet are the <hi>tame,</hi> ſc. the calfe, oxe, cow, bull, lamb, weather, ram, ewe, kid, goat, pig, ſow, boar, and hog: amongſt the <hi>wild;</hi> the wild boare and ſow, red and fallow deere, roebuck and capreol, hare, conie, and ſquirrels, &amp;c. of which, ſee more in their proper places. Of theſe, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of ſome is <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> fit for fine complexions, idle and tender perſons, and ſuch as recover out of ſome great ſickneſſe, as rabbets, &amp;c. others are more <hi>groſſe, tough</hi> and hard, agreeing chiefely with country perſons and ſuch as labour, and ſecondarily with thoſe that are ſtrong uſing much exerciſe, and accuſtomed to feed thereon, as the bull, and hog, &amp;c. others are of a <hi>middle</hi> ſubſtance, and generally the beſt, and moſt proper aliment, ingendering mean blood, agreeing almoſt with all ages, times, and complexions, neither binding the body or looſening it, neither ſtrengthning nor weakening the ſtomach, neither procuring nor hindering urin or ſweat, cauſing no alteration in the firſt qualities, neither over-nouriſhing or extenuating the body, but preſerving it in ſuch ſtate as before, and reſtoring little more than is daily decayed; as the heifer, calfe, ſheep, lamb, kid, pig, and coney. As for the <hi>Temperature,</hi> ſome are <hi>hot;</hi> as the lamb, hog, pig, in the firſt degree; in the ſecond, the hare, and roe-buck: others are <hi>cold</hi> as the cow, ſteere, coney, rabbet, &amp; young hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogs, in the firſt degree; ſome are <hi>moiſt,</hi> us the wild boare, &amp;c. in the firſt degree, in the ſecond, the hedgbuck, &amp;c. in the third, young hogs, and pigs: others are <hi>dry;</hi> as the oxe, deere, hare, and coney, in the ſecond degree. In reſpect of <hi>Taſte,</hi> ſome are <hi>ſweet;</hi> which agree well with nature, being of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heate, and ſo fitteſt for nouriſhment, they delight the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and liver, fatten the body, increaſe naturall heate, fill the veines, digeſt eaſily, ſoften that which is two hard, and thicken what is too liquid; but if over ſweet and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, they ſoone turne into choller, ſtop the liver, puffe up the

lungs, and ſpleen, ſwell the ſtomach, and often cauſe ſharp feavers: the <hi>bitter,</hi> if exceeding, doe not much nouriſh, except firſt boiled or infuſed in many waters, they otherwiſe engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring cholerick humours, and burning bloud, they kill worms, open obſtructions, cleanſe the body, but nouriſh little or not at all, and that which is, is derived only to ſome ſpeciall parts: thoſe made <hi>ſharp,</hi> dry the body exceedingly, hurt the eyes and liver, &amp;c. drawing down humours, ſending up vapours, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the blood, fretting the guts, and extinuating the whole body; therefore they are to be taſted or fed upon, their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being allay'd with waſhing, infuſion, oiling, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of ſweet things: thoſe made <hi>ſoure,</hi> though they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally offend ſinewey parts weaken concoction, coole naturall heat, make loane, and haſten old age; yet they are profitable in cutting phlegme, opening obſtructions, clenſing impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, bridling choller, reſiſting putrifaction, extinguiſhing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous heat, ſtaying loathſomeneſſe of ſtomach, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring appetite; but if made ſoure without ſharpneſſe, they ſtrengthen the ſtomach, bind and corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:170401:21"/>
according to the reliſh uſually, and the unſavoury nouriſh leſſe and not ſpeedily: alſo what hath here been ſaid of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and taſte, agreeth alſo to birds, fiſhes, and other edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. As for the <hi>age,</hi> the fleſh of thoſe that are <hi>young,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if newly brought forth, is ſlimy, ſoft, moiſt, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious, eſpecially when they are moſt moiſt by nature; yet it is ſooner concocted, and makes the belly ſoluble: the fleſh of thoſe that are <hi>old,</hi> is hard, dry, nervous, hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and of little and bad nouriſhment: <hi>wainelings,</hi> are leſſe hard and dry than the one; and more firme, temperate, and nouriſhing than the other; but generally they are beſt for moſt complexions, when they are almoſt come to their full growth, both in height, length, and bigneſſe, their temper being then beſt, and ſo moſt agreeable to our naturall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, being in a mean: the ſame may be ſaid of birds, as of beaſts. In reſpect of <hi>ſex,</hi> the fleſh of the <hi>males,</hi> is more ſtrong, dry, and heavy of digeſtion; the <hi>females</hi> ſweeter, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and of more eaſy concoction; but the males are to be preferred, being hotter, dryer, more laborious, and leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious, when gelt, as appeares, in oxen and weathers: when gelt they are more tender, ſweet, and of an eaſier di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, as appeares in barrow hoggs; they then being of a middle nature. As for their <hi>feeding,</hi> thoſe that feed in moiſt and mooriſh places, have moiſt fleſh, and full of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; but thoſe that feed on dry places and mountaines, are without excrements, more eaſy of digeſtion, and fit to nouriſh: thoſe that feed in good paſtures, are ſweeter and more nouriſhing; ſo thoſe that feed upon ſweet herbs; alſo the fleſh of wild beaſts is leſſe excrementitious and dryer, than that of the tame; ſo likewiſe of birds. And as to the <hi>preparation,</hi> beaſts after they have been fatted with goood food, as often as they deſire it, in a clean and ſpatious place, and chaſed,
<pb facs="tcp:170401:21"/>
then killed in their ſeaſon; they either keep relinquiſh or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their property by preparation; here therefore it's to be noted, that flaſhy meate and naturally moiſt, ſhould be dreſſed with a dry heate, (as in baking, broiling, frying, and roſting,) and meats naturally exceeding in aryneſſe and firmneſſe ſhould ever be boiled; and the temperate may be uſed any way: if <hi>crude,</hi> it's eaten only by the barbarians: if <hi>roſted,</hi> it yeeldeth a dry aliment, and often retaineth the excrements: if <hi>aduſt,</hi> it's worſe: if <hi>fryed</hi> with externall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, it's ſweet, by reaſon of its fat humidity, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it doth not conveniently emit its internall ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but rather imbibeth more of the redundant externall, it's hardly concocted, nidorulent, and torrifieth the bloud: if ſeaſoned with ſalt, and ſpices, it is yet dryer: if <hi>boiled</hi> it's dryer within, yet by reaſon of exteriour humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, it moiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Note alſo that fleſh engendreth better, purer, and more perfect bloud, than fiſh, &amp; for ſound men is the beſt ſuſtenance. As for the <hi>Parts</hi> of beaſts. The <hi>muſculous fleſh</hi> is more hot by vivifick heate, than in birds, &amp; therefore they grow larger: the <hi>head,</hi> is edible, ſc. of the cow, calfe, ſow, boar, kid, &amp; hare, &amp;c. but of hard concoction, thick and viſcous juyce, yet of much
<pb facs="tcp:170401:22"/>
nouriſhment: the <hi>tongue</hi> is looſe, fungous, humid, and glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, therefore it yeeldeth not a ſolid, thick, or laſting ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet in ſome it is moſt ſweet, ſoft, of good juyce, eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and good aliment; but the part exerted is harder; the tongues of calves, kids, lambs, hogs, and ſheep, are of eaſy digeſtion, and breed laudable juyce, neats tongue is thicker, but more fit for nouriſhment and not dryed: the <hi>eares,</hi> are cartilagineous, &amp; nouriſh little, except eaten with the vieine parts: the <hi>eyes,</hi> of thoſe that are young, ſeperated from their skinne, fat, bals, and humours, are of a tender and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fleſh, which is very eaſy of digeſtion, eſpecially the calves: the <hi>cheeks,</hi> if of young, ſat, and carnoſe beaſts, are of good juyce, and thoſe of calves moſt tender: the <hi>brain,</hi> is pituitous, of thick juyce, hardly diſtributed, and concocted, cauſing nauſeouſneſſe and vomiting, and helps againſt poyſon by its viſcidity; thoſe of calves, lambs, kids, and pigs, are to be eaten at the beginning of meales, the pigs are to be dreſſed at the fire being the moiſteſt: the <hi>pallate,</hi> which is commended in the cow, hath a certaine membranous fleſh, and is often uſed in pies: the <hi>ſnowt,</hi> in hogs, is worſe than the feet, but better than the head. The <hi>heart,</hi> is hard of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that of the hog cauſeth ſadneſſe, it nouriſheth little; but if well concocted, the nouriſhment is not weak or bad. The <hi>lungs,</hi> are of a cold and moiſt temperament, pituitous juyce, &amp; of eaſy concoction and diſtribution, by reaſon of their rarity and levity, ſome ſay they cauſe inflation of the belly, they are of a froathy ſubſtance, &amp; they are good for young men ſick of hot agues; but bad for ſtrong and labouring men, ſo light a meat not ſufficiently nouriſhing them, but putrifying in the ſtomach; thoſe of foxes are not wholſome, but rather medicine for ſore lungs; they are ſofter than the heart, liver, kidnies, and ſpleenes; but not inferiour to the liver, as to nouriſhment. The <hi>liver,</hi> of all animals, is of thick
<pb facs="tcp:170401:22"/>
juyce, hardly concocted, &amp; ſlowly penetrating; that of hogs is preferred, that of lambs and kids doth more eaſily paſſe along, and is of leſſe thick juyce; that of goats is ſaid to cauſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick convulſions, no leſſe than the hee goats; but the hogs with the fat, is commended; uſually they cauſe obſtructions. The <hi>ſpleen,</hi> drawing thick lutulent and melancholick blood, yeeldeth alſo a like nouriſhment; thoſe that are reddiſh, as the hoggs; being tinged with a leſſe evill blood, are not of ſo bad juyce; others are hardly concocted and diſtributed, &amp; of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant taſte. The <hi>reines,</hi> are of ill juyce, an ungratefull ſapour, &amp; hard concoction; thoſe of kids and calves, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard or virous, are commended; others are of thick juyce, betwixt fleſh and kernels, allwaies having a ſmack of that which paſſeth through them, and being two ſtrong for moſt ſtomachs, after ſucking. The <hi>teſticles,</hi> being virous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after coiture, are hard, and not eaſily concocted, but thoſe of hogs are preferred, and thoſe of lambs are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; thoſe of boares help decayed bodies, and cauſe luſt, ſo thoſe of bucks, and ſtaggs. The <hi>womb,</hi> is of cold and crude juyce, therefore hardly concocted and of little juyce. The <hi>ventricle,</hi> what nouriſhment it yeeldeth, may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured from its conſtitution, it is filmy, and therefore cold, hard, dry, and glutinous; it is of hard digeſtion, generates phlegme, begets obſtructions, and is the cauſe of many diſeaſes; ſoft and ſedentary men muſt abſtaine from it, it being fit only for porters, ploughmen, and mariners. The <hi>guts,</hi> are of the ſame nature; but thoſe of lambs, and kids, are of an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier ſubſtance and concoction; the other are farre harder than fleſh, hardly concocted, of little nouriſhment, &amp; unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, cauſing itches, and leproſies, &amp;c. The <hi>meſentery,</hi> if of a young calfe and fat, is good with a little vineger.

nature; the lean muſt be ſod tender in fat broth, the fat may be ſod alone; but each of them needs firſt a little corning with ſalt, being naturally of a phlegmatick and moiſt ſubſtance. The <hi>feet,</hi> and other <hi>extreme parts,</hi> of fourefooted beaſts, conſiſting ef membrans, ligaments, nerves, veines, arteries, and griſtles, are cold, and dry, clammy, viſcous, of little nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and hard digeſtion, except of young and ſucking animals, as of hogs, pigs, lambs, and calves; alſo a tender cow heele is counted reſtorative, and pigs pettitoes boild in barley water for the aguiſh; the ſodden feet of geeſe alſo were counted reſtorative. The <hi>kernels,</hi> are ſweet, tender, and ſhort, yeelding a thick nouriſhment; and if the beaſt be ſound, very good; and being well concocted in the ſtomach, they nouriſh as much as muſculous fleſh; not well digeſted, they breed flegmatick and raw juyce, ſc. thoſe of the breaſt; of the other, thoſe that are ſoft generate phlegmatick blood, &amp; the hard, that which is raw; the ſweet breads of beaſts, are beſt firſt roſted, then boiled, their ſuperfluous moiſture being ſo conſumed. The <hi>fat,</hi> hinders appetite, gluts the ſtomach, hardly digeſteth, turneth wholy to excrements, &amp; decayeth the retentive powers, eſpecially that of greater beaſts; it relaxeth the ſtomach, cauſeth nauſeouſneſſe, turnes into choller in hot bodies, and is rather ſawce for our meat than nouriſhment. The <hi>marrow,</hi> is the ſweet of fat, as it were, ſecretly convey'd, into bones; ſweet, unctuous, and pleaſant of taſte, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuch whoſe bodies are dry, and ſtomachs able to digeſt it: it may be ſod uſually with capons, cockrels, and henns, in a nouriſhing white broth; or pies may be made thereof; but it ſoone cauſeth ſurfeits: of all; that of the deere is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome to be eaſieſt of digeſtion, next that of a young mutton, and that of beefe the heauieſt,
<pb facs="tcp:170401:23"/>
that of a goat is offenſive, and that of lambs or calves not good, being crude, bloody, and imperfect for want of age: the chine or <hi>pithmarrow,</hi> is much harder and dryer, than the brain it ſelfe, eſpecially towards the further end of the back; which dryneſſe makes it leſſe loathſome to the ſtomach, than brains are; and it ſtrengthneth that body, which is able to concoct it: ſome make candles therewith and yolks of new laid eggs, to reſtore nature, and recover the weakneſſe of the loines cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by venery. The <hi>tripes,</hi> are farre harder in ſubſtance, than their fleſh, long in concocting, nouriſhing little, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious, ingendring filthy diſeaſes. The <hi>skinne</hi> of beaſts, even of roſted pigge is ſo farre from nouriſhing, that it can hardly be well digeſted of a ſtrong ſtomach. This is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the ſeverall parts of Quadrupedes: there are diverſe other things taken and made from them.

The <hi>Temperature,</hi> of ſome is <hi>hot,</hi> as of the goſling, partridg, quaile, thruſh, in the firſt degree; in the ſecond, the turkie, peacock, pigeon, duck, &amp; turtle; others are <hi>colder</hi> than the former; ſome are <hi>moiſt</hi> in the ſecond degree, as the turkie, young pigeon, ducks, &amp; young quailes; others <hi>dry,</hi> as the peacock, and heath-cock in the first degree; in the ſecond, the partridg, turtle, thruſh, and blackbirds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others are <hi>temperate,</hi> as a young pullet, crowing cockrel, grown capon, hens egges poched, and all ſmall birds when young. As to the <hi>taſte,</hi> they are diverſe. The <hi>preparation</hi> after feeding with good meat as often as they deſire it, in a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious place, and rightly killed, garbelled, and pulled, must be by boyling, rosting, or baking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the aforeſaid rules, about beasts. In reſpect of <hi>age,</hi> the young are moſt moiſt tender and excrementitious, and the old more tough heavy lean and dry, and the full grown beſt. As to the <hi>ſexe,</hi> the males are more ſtrong, dry, and heavy of digestion, and the females are ſweeter moiſter and more eaſily concocted; but the kerned are of a better nature. According to their <hi>feeding,</hi> thoſe that feed themſelves abroad fat with wholſome meat, are of better nouriſhment, than ſuch as are cram'd in a coop: and thoſe that live in moiſt and mooriſh places, have a more moist and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious fleſh, and harder of digeſtion; thoſe that feed upon mountaines, have dryer fleſh, more eaſily concocted, and void of excrements; the fleſh of the tame nouriſheth more than
<pb facs="tcp:170401:27"/>
that of the wild, and roſted or fryed they are dryer than boyled: Alſo the purer their meat is, the better they are themſelves; and thoſe that feed upon fleſh and garbage, are not ſo wholſome as thoſe that feed upon corne, bents, and ſeeds, thoſe that feed upon wormes and fiſhes at the ſides of the water are worſe; and ſuch as eate ſerpents, and ſpiders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the worst, yet, may be more medicinable, and thoſe taken by flight are preferred; and thoſe that have the whitest fleſh are of eaſiest digeſtion, the red fleſhed are of ſtrongest nouriſhment; and that which is of black fleſh, is hardly digeſted, and of ſlow nouriſhment, and ſo much the worſe, by how much the fleſh and skin is blacker. As for the <hi>Parts</hi> of birds. The <hi>combs</hi> of cocks, ſome reckon amongſt meats, and they are counted aphrodiſiaſtick. The <hi>wings</hi> are of good juyce and eaſy concoction, their crude ſuperfluous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity being conſumed by exerciſe; the Pinions are of like diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the feet of beaſts; yet thoſe of geeſe, hens, capons, and chickens are of good nouriſhment. The <hi>rump</hi> which is most fleſhy and fat in thoſe that have ſhort leggs, doth often cauſe nauſeouſnes, they are correſpondent to the rumps of beaſts, having kernels, and cloying the stomach. The <hi>brain</hi> is more dry and hard, than that of quadrupeds, and that of mountain birds better than the other of ſuch as live about fens and fields; that of cocks, partridges, and pheſants is moſt ſweet, and that of ſparrows and pigeons is venerious; but none are abſolutely commendable, except of ſuch foul as are temperate, as cocks, chickens, capons, pullets, partridges, and pheaſants; alſo thoſe of roſted wood-cocks, ſnites, black birds, and all ſmall birds, are counted wholſome; but thoſe of great birds, water-foule, pigeons, and all ſorts of wild doves are counted bad; yet thoſe of quailes help the epilepſy, and the cranes the hemorrhoids. The <hi>neck</hi> is hurtful to the eyes by reaſon of blood coagulated there, yet ſome ſay, ala mala, coxa noxa, crura dura, cropium dubium, collum bonum. The <hi>tongue,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:170401:27"/>
more muſculous it is, the better, and that of geeſe cauſeth luste; but thoſe of birds, are generally very dry, hard, and griſtly, except thoſe of parrets. The <hi>heart</hi> is of a fibrous and hard ſubstance, hardly concocted and diſtributed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eaten, it cauſeth melancholick blood, &amp; it nouriſheth little, except overcome. The <hi>lungs</hi> are eaſily concocted by reaſon of their rarity, and nouriſh little. The <hi>ventricle,</hi> which for the most part is carnoſe and callous, is moſt ſweet in geeſe, that of hens is more fleſhy than callous. The <hi>inteſtine,</hi> of ſome is uſed, as the larks, wood-cocks, and ſuites, when freſh. The <hi>liver</hi> is hot and moiſt, ſutable to our heat, that of geeſe is very nouriſhing; thoſe of tame foule, as hens, capons, chickens, ducklings, and geeſe, fatted with wholeſome meat, pleaſe the taste, clear the eye-ſight, agree with the ſtomach, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe blood; thoſe of cranes ſod in the broth of cicers, aſſwage the pain of the back and kidnies, but they are of ſmall and bad nouriſhment; thoſe of larks &amp; ſuites are very ſweet &amp; reſtora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive, as alſo of the wood-kock, which hath the greateſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of all other birds. The <hi>teſticles,</hi> which are beſt in cocks fed with a ſeroſe meat, steeped in milk, are deſired by the delicate, as promoters of luſt, and ſome ſay, that being kept from the hens, they will every day adde ſo much fleſh to the body, as the ſtones themſelves are in weight; ſome attribute the ſame to thoſe of ſparrows, pheaſants and partridges. The <hi>feet,</hi> having but little fleſh, nouriſh but little; and having nerves and tendons concoct difficultly, thoſe of geeſe are counted reſtorative. The <hi>skin</hi> of thoſe that are fat, is ſweet, but of little nutriment, and hard concoction, but that of the loines of cocks is moſt ſweet; that of the neck, if rugous and fat, is better boiled than ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; yet the skin of no bird turneth to nouriſhment, but rather to ill humours, or filthy excrements, and ſome
<pb facs="tcp:170401:28"/>
birds are ſodden or roſted without them, being black or bitter, as rookes, daws, coots, and moore hens. The <hi>marrow</hi> of the back, is of the ſame vertue, as the brain, but ſomewhat harder; that of the bones is more pleaſant and fat, but being leberally eaten, it cauſeth nauſeouſneſſe. The <hi>fat,</hi> moderately taken with ſalt, nouriſheth a little but not well, yet pleaſantly; it deſtroyes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, wine being drunk after it, the ventricle being made ſmooth, and the wrinkles taken away; but that of little birds and ſmall chickens, is not amiſſe, being ſoone overcome, but of ſuch the lean is best. The <hi>kernels</hi> are counted reſtorative. The <hi>egges</hi> conſiſt of a yolk and white, that is eaſily inflamed and turned into fumes; but this is cold, glutinous, begetteth ill blood, and is hardly concocted, but together they generally agree with all ſtomacks: the <hi>beſt</hi> are thoſe of hens, partridges, and pheaſants, being of the young and fat trodden by the cock, new, white and long, ſuch nouriſhing quickly, plentifully, clearing the voice and breast, &amp; strengthing the stomach, helping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and increaſing nature; &amp; are beſt in the winter, &amp; morning eaten alone, they otherwiſe corrupting; and <hi>hurt</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and old men, but are good for temperate young perſons, in fluxes, ſharp humours, and weakneſſe; others are of a bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ſtrong ſavour, and worſe, as of ducks, geeſe and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, and of all water-foul, and the paler, being more aqueous; the <hi>trembling</hi> are of much nouriſhment, good juyce, eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and distribution, and generate good blood; the <hi>ſorbile</hi> nouriſh leſſe, and help aſperity; the <hi>boiled</hi> are hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, paſſe ſlowly, and yeeld thick aliment; the <hi>roſted</hi> are groſſer, and worſe if covered with aſhes, but better on the coles, and ſod in water; if <hi>tryed,</hi> they become nidorous, corrupt other meat, and cauſe thick juyce; and the <hi>poch't</hi> are beſt for hot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexions.

ſome count most dainty ſweet and nouriſhing meat, and are <hi>beſt</hi> towards winter having ſcoured themſelves, and thoſe are to be preferred that are of a midle ſize, feeding in the ſummer time in hilly places upon wholſome herbs, and are to be eaten after ſeptember: alſo they are <hi>bad</hi> for thoſe that are of cold and moist complexions, being cold <hi>1</hi>°. and moist <hi>2</hi>°. but help thoſe that are hot, cholerick, thirſty, inflamed, watchful, and thoſe that have ulcers of the lungs being parboil'd in warme water, and ſo broil'd upon the coles, and eaten. As touching the uſe of inſects in <hi>medicine,</hi> there is little to be ſaid in general; but of them, as alſo of the rest of the irrational animals, ſee more after, more particularly, in Alphabetical order.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of <hi>Animals,</hi> as to their general <hi>differences,</hi> in reſpect of parts, magnitude, place, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, meat, generation, motion, voice, life, and actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with their uſe as <hi>Meats,</hi> with their <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> as conſidered in kind, ſubstance, tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taſte, preparation, age, ſexe, feeding, and place; and of their ſeveral parts, both natural and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, in general; as alſo of their uſe in <hi>Medicine:</hi> it may not be amiſſe to adde ſomething concerning <hi>Sawces, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſerve to help the want of appetite and digestion, and fit each meat to the ſeveral ſtomacks, by which it is to be received.</p>

If new and hot, it's thirſty, and windy; if two dayes old, dry &amp; hardly concocted; if old &amp; muſty it's melancholick, and binding; if heavy it's flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb facs="tcp:170401:33"/>
and troubleſome; and the biſket is dry; if branny, it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth beſt, but paſſeth ſooneſt through the belly, but the finer is more nouriſhing; the domeſtick is good, the unleavened is heavy, and the unſalted obſtructive: alſo <hi>Drink</hi> is no leſſe neceſſary, ſerving to mix the meat and bread, and help their diſtribution, restore the humid ſubſtance of the body, and quench thirſt, help to concoction, and fuſion, and to hinder inflammation of the nutritive fat; and the most ſimple is <hi>Water,</hi> the pureſt of which is cold and moiſt, and the beſt is clear, limpid, without muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or contents, taſte or ſmell, thin and ſmooth, which runs preſently through the hypochondria, and is ſoon distributed through the body, ſoone hot or cold, and lighteſt: Therefore Fountain water is to be preferred, having theſe qualities, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern and running through ſand or gravel, the ſouthern and northern are worſe, raw, heavy, and of ſlow paſſage; it's bad if running through pipes: Rain water is next best, being brought in earthen pipes into a ciſtern, or through gravel, in ſpring, and with gentle ſhowres, and kept clean in a ciſtern; it's worſe, if falling in ſtormes; if with thunder it's moſt light and thin, but ſoone corrupting; that of ſnow and ice, is thick, hurts the ventricle, and cauſeth griefs of the joynts and bowels; that taken in ciſterns is bad if falling from houſes, by reaſon of the lime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well waters are thick and heavy, obstructing, yet are better having good fountains neere them, drawn out of deep wells, if the ſun come at them, often drawn, cleanſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from dung hills, and the water is ſweet in clay, colder in tophous earth, thin in ſand, and beſt amongſt red stones, of good taste in gravel, cold at the bottom of mountains, and beſt amongſt ſtones and flints: River-water is ſometimes preferred before well water, being ſweet, and clear, and taken from ſwift ſtreams, flowing in good ground, and a temperate region: That of ſtanding pooles, and lakes, is the worſt, thick, raw, and ſometimes malignant, hurting the ſtomach, corrupting the
<pb facs="tcp:170401:33"/>
humours, ſtopping the bowels, and cauſing putrid feavers: but water may be corrected by boyling it. An other ſort of drink is <hi>Beere,</hi> which is made of wheat, oats, or rye, but chiefely of barly, which by reaſon of hopps is hot and diuretical; and if new, it's unwholſome, obstructive, and begets the ſtone; the defecated is more wholſome; and ale is ſaid to make fat: As for <hi>Metheglin,</hi> it's hot, and ſoon turned into choller: And <hi>Wine</hi> generally is hot and dry, cheriſhing the heart, increaſing the ſpirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the ſtrength, purging choller by urin, and provoking the expulſion of excrements; and the Muſcadine is of good juyce; Malago heats the stomach, and helps the collick. The Rheniſh is thin, ſtrengthning the heart, and reſtorative. The Thin ſoon penetrats, quickly reſtoreth, openeth, provokes ſweat and urin, and is of leſſe aliment, ſuch is the aquoſe, deep yellow, and yellow; the Thick is more nutritive, heating, drying, ſticking, and ſometimes obstructing, as the black, red, ſweet, and auſtere; the White is colder than the yellow or deep yellow, if thin alſo; the deep Yellow is next it, and good if thin; the Red doth moderately heat, begets good blood, &amp; troubles not the head, if thick alſo, but obſtructeth the ſpleen &amp; liver; Claret is almoſt of the ſame vertue; the Black is of a thicker ſubstance, for the most part ſweet, very nouriſhing, and begets thick blood, but cauſeth obſtructions and filleth the head; the Sweet nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth well, and is pleaſant to the pallat, bowels, lungs, and mouth, and troubleth not the head, but obstructeth and turneth into choller; the Auſtere is leſſe hot, reſteth longer in the belly, penetrats to the paſſages of urin, and helps fluxes, but becauſe it reſtraineth ſpittle, it's not to be uſed in the deſeaſes of the breaſt; and the Mean is beſt; the Fragrant by it's ſmell reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth strength; increaſeth the ſpirits, and strengthneth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and is good for old men, but that it fills the head, and troubleth the nerves; that without ſmell is not ſo deſired or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; and that affected with an other ſmell is noxious; Muſte
<pb facs="tcp:170401:34"/>
cauſeth the collick and hindreth urin; the New is excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, of difficult distribution, and cauſeth fluctuation; the Old troubleth the nerves and head; but the Mean is better for uſe: Thus meat in general is a more groſſe and corporeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, taken either from living creatures living upon the earth, or living ever or ſometimes in the water; or vegetables in the earth, whereby the groſſer part of our body is preſerved; and liquours are thin and liquid nouriſhment, ſerving as a ſted to convey meat to every member, and are converted moſt eaſily into humours in the body.</p>
            <p>This is the chief matter of meat and drink, by which the body of man is preſerved, augmented, and ſtrengthned, there is further to be obſerved, that what is according to nature is to be preſerved, a mean is alwayes to be followed, ſuddain muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be avoided, things accuſtomed are not preſently to be left off, bodies in exact health are to be cheriſhed with their likes; thoſe that recede from it, are by little and little, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, to be reduced to the contrary; occult qualities are ſo to be preſerved that the temper of the body be not hurt; the innate heat of all the parts is to be preſerved by moderate heaters and binders. The <hi>Aire</hi> moſt wholſome, must be temperate, pure, clean, thin, open, free, without any ill vapours, moiſtneſſe or corruption, but moved with gentle winds, and ſerene, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>ſc.</hi> hot and moiſt in ſpring, hot and dry in ſummer, cold and dry in autumne, cold and moiſt in winter, ſo for the months according to the quadrature of the moon, and for the dayes, in reſpect of morning noon evening and night, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which are according to the qualities, and winds, yet all winds in their proper nature, moiſten and cool, but alter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſite and condition of places through which they blow, the ſeptentrional being moſt vehement, the oriental mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately hot and dry, and moiſt from the ſea; the occidental moderately cold and moiſt, and the meridional watriſh ſhowry
<pb facs="tcp:170401:34"/>
and ſickly; it's altered alſo by the ſtarrs, meteors, as fiery aereal aqueous or impure, zones; cardinal regions, the oriental being moderately temperate, and healthy; the occidental ſickly, the meridional making moiſt, and the ſeptentrional dry; by the parts of the world, kingdoms, and provinces, cities and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; particular constitution of places; being pure in high, moist in low, mean in plain, thin in the ſtony, open in mountains, cloudy in woods, moiſt neere rivers, ſickly in fennes, wholſome in marine places, &amp; various neere baths: that is to be ſhunned that is stinking, and ſuddain mutations therein are not to be made, the cold is to be altered with fire, hangings, or ſtoves; the hot by cold water, roſes strewed, water-lillies, nettles, willows, and leaves of trees; the moiſt by fire, and aromatick fumes; the dry by irrigation of waters, and moiſtning herbs; the peſtilent with the fume of aromatick wood, and frankincenſe, thoſe that are idle are to walk in the open aire and fields, in the morning about mountains, and fountaines and rivers in the evening.</p>
            <p>Then as for <hi>Meat,</hi> it is to be temperate, and familiar, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uſuall, <hi>ſc.</hi> the fleſh of animals, and fiſhes, with bread well baked; alſo ſimple, or various, yet not of a diverſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or qualities at the ſame time, that it may be concocted at the ſame time, with the ſame heat, and not being taken in too great a quantity, and it's convenient; firm fleſh, thin blood, ſweet phlegme, bitter gall, and ſouriſh melancholy being to be preſerved; but they muſt be well prepared, orderly taken, and no errour committed in quantity, time, order and manner of eating; it's neceſſary in ſickneſse alſo if compound, of which more particularly after. And as for the <hi>Quantity</hi> of meat, it is either full, increaſing fleſh, ſpirits and humours; and is fit for thoſe that are young, growing, ſtrong, luſty, and able to endure much exerciſe: or moderate, repairing fleſh, ſpirits, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours loſt; and is fitteſt for perſons of a midle health, of an eſtate of body neither perfectly strong, nor very weak: or elſe
<pb facs="tcp:170401:35"/>
thin, leſſening fleſh ſpirits and humours for a time to preſerve life, and the ſtricteſt eſpecially is to be uſed, only where there are violent diſeaſes, cauſed by fulneſſe or corruption, where the ſickneſſe is abated by the ſubſtraction of ſufficient food. Alſo a man in health, muſt never eat to ſatisfy, but riſe with a quick appetite. If drowſy, weary and heavy after eating, being before nimble &amp; cheereful, it's a ſigne that accuſtomed meaſure is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and that the quantity muſt be diminiſhed, till ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences ceaſe. If after meals, there be unfitneſſe for the actions of the mind, as ſtudy, contemplation, and other functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind and body, then the due proportion is exceeded. If there be too much repletion, there muſt be evacuation; and that is known, by pain and heavineſſe of the head, long and troubled ſleeps, troubleſome dreams, ſleep in the day-time after meals, lazineſse, wearineſſe, pain in the whole body, or any part thereof, want of appetite, crudities in the ſtomach, ſower bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, binding of the belly, frequent diſtillations, ſtopping of the noſe after ſupper, with little excrement evacuated, and much in the morning, much ſpitting, unuſual abundance of wind, and looſeneſſe. If a change be to be made, it muſt be by degrees, till come to a proportion not offending the functions of the body or mind; and ſeveral ſorts of meat are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the ſame time, ſome being concocted ſooner, others more ſlowly, and ſo there is an evil concoction. The <hi>Quality</hi> of meats alſo is to be regarded, there being like food like fleſh, like meat like nouriſhment. And the temperate are beſt for all ſorts of perſons, eſpecially for thoſe well tempered, as fleſh and bread of good juyce. The quality is to be heeded; it altering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the body. That is to be uſed which is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to every ones particular nature, age, temperature, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, and complexion. Young, hot, ſtrong, and labouring men may eat hard &amp; groſse meats, as beife, bacon, poudered fleſh and fiſh, hard cheeſe, hard eggs, and rye-bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:170401:35"/>
may be concocted by degrees, and nouriſh ſlowly; the lighter meats, as veal, lamb, capons, chickens, partridges, pheaſants, or plovers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in them, being too ſoon digested, and turned into choller; and milk is beſt for children, tender fleſh for ſuch as grow, and liquid meats for ſuch as are ſick of ſharp diſeaſes. If the body be bound, the diet muſt be moiſt, and of boiled meats; but dry, if moiſt. Sweet meats are bad for young children, and men, and for hot ſtomachs; but help thoſe that are old and cold. The bitter engender choller, burn blood, and give no general nouriſhment to the whole. Sharp ſpices hurt tender bodies, but the ſtrong may eat them with groſſe meats Soure meats with ſharp, as citrons, limons, oranges, and vineger, hurt cold stomachs, and ſinewy parts; but if cold and aſtringent, as ſorrel, quinces, ſervices, and medlars, they help the ſtomach eaten laſt, except ſubject to fluxes. Thoſe over-ſalted help thoſe only that toile and labour, cauſing inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Fatty are good only for cold and dry ſtomachs. All meats are to be given very hot to cold &amp; raw ſtomacks. They are to be contrary to the diſeaſe when ſick, that which is naturally or accidentaly loathed, is not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten greedily when hungry, being turned into wind, belchings, vimitings, and gripings. A ſtrong and good ſtomach may taſte of all things, but not feed on them as nouriſhments. The <hi>Time</hi> of eating, depends upon custome, but that houre may be omitted if the appetite be not quick, yet it's moſt convenient to eat twice in the day. The ſupper, in ſome that are healthy and in the flower of youth, ought to be equal or larger than the dinner; but in others more ſparing; and the moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hour of dining, is about <hi>2.</hi> or <hi>3.</hi> houres before noon, and it's moſt wholſome: as for break faſts, in cloſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and times of ſickneſſe, they are very neceſſary; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it's beſt to faſt till dinner, where the air is clear, and wholſome, except growing or chollerick, the meals
<pb facs="tcp:170401:36"/>
are to be often for children and much, little and often for old men, labourers very often, <hi>ſc. 4.</hi> or <hi>5.</hi> times in a day, if work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard; and the time, quantity, and frequency may be altered by cuſtom, ſickneſſe and appetite. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Order</hi> of aliments is this, that thin meats, liquid, eaſy of concoction, looſening and eaſily deſcending, are to be firſt taken, and the contrary laſt. At the beginning of the meal, ſome broth, fleſh, or ſome what elſe actually hot, is to be taken, not drinking firſt; but drink with meat is neceſſary, without fluctuation, the moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing meat is to be eaten firſt, and the cold laſt, if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mach be hot; the breakfaſt may be of liquid meats, the dinner of moist and boiled, and the ſupper chiefely of roſted meats. As for the <hi>Manner of eating,</hi> it is to be with fine chewing, leiſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, ſitting upright for an houres time or leſſe; except longer time be confirmed by cuſtom, or alleviated by paſtime or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but the time of ſitting is not to be very long or ſhort, that the meat may deſcend, and not too hastily ſettle. Here alſo the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> and delight in the uſe of meats is to be obſerved, the uſuall being more profitable though not ſo good, and that not only in the ſubſtance, but quality, quantity, and time of eating alſo; and if it be changed, it must be by degrees, and the moſt pleaſing is to be uſed. In reſpect of <hi>Age,</hi> the meat and diet of children ſhould be cold and moiſt, given in a great quantity: it's to be midling in quantity and quality for youths and young men, and cold and moiſt: and it muſt be leſſe for old men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Seaſon of the year,</hi> in Winter it muſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, hot and dry, and drink more ſparing, and wine pure: in the Spring it must be moderate in quantity and quality, more hot and copious than in ſummer, but leſſe than in winter: in Summer it muſt be cold and moiſt, ſmall in quantity, but with more drink: in Autumne, it must be fuller, hotter, and dryer than in ſummer, and leſſe at the beginning than at the latter end. And this is to be obſerved, the Spring being temperate, in a mean between the firſt qualities, or moderately hot and

moiſtens and makes pale, if bare it cauſeth evaporation. If by Quoits, it helps the limbs, but hurts bad reines, &amp; breaſt; if by Shooting, it cauſeth a good habit. Moderate Walking helps defluxions and retentions; if ſwift, it extenuats; if ſlow, it helps old men; if too much, it diſcuſſeth and hurts the head; if much it helps the pined lower parts, and head affected by the breaſt; if little, it helps the heavy body; if long and ſtraight it helps the head, and dryeth; if long and ſwift it helps hickets; if ſhort and turning it hurts the head; if upon the heels it helps a moiſt breaſt; and the belly bound, if on the toes; if up hil, it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, and cauſeth ſweat, but hurts weak knees; if down hil, it draws from the head, but hurts weak thighs; if through unequal places, it's good for ſuch as are ſoon wearied; if through rough, it fills the head; if on ſand it ſtrengtheneth; in a cloſe place it's bad; if by the ſea it dryeth and attenuats; by rivers, it moiſtens; it's bad in the dew; and in winds, it's according as it's ſaid of them before, as they alter the aire; if in the ſun, it hurts the head; but it's good under mirtles, bay-trees, amongſt ſweet herbs, &amp; in fair weather; if in the morning, it looſens, quickens, and helps appetite, and moiſt bodies; in the evening it prepares for ſleep, helps inflations, but hurts the head; a little after meat, is good, to help deſcent.

And it's hurtful at noon, except great labour did precede, or ſickneſſe or weakneſſe, or wearineſſe &amp; watchfulneſſe, or to recal the heat to the internal parts in a hot day, if uſual, &amp; then it muſt be very long, or ſhort; the body being upright, and that, after dinner, a gentle walk being uſed, &amp; it muſt be the longer, the weaker the digeſtion is &amp; ſlow; &amp; it muſt be firſt on the right ſide, then on the left, the head being higheſt, &amp; the limbs gathered up: alſo lying on the belly helps concoction, but hurts the ſight; but if on the back, it hinders the evacuation of excrements, and hurts thoſe that are ſubject to the ſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. Watching, if moderate, doth excite the ſpirits &amp; ſenſes, &amp; helps to diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the evacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of excrements; but if immoderate, it diſſipats the ſpirits, dryeth the body, chiefely the brain, increaſeth choller, inflames, &amp; the heat being diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cauſeth cold diſeaſes. <hi>Excretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> &amp; <hi>rete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions</hi> likewiſe muſt be regarded, the excrements being too long retained, begetting ſeveral diſeaſes, <hi>ſc.</hi> apepſie, nauſeouſneſſe, putrid vapours, the collick, giddineſs &amp; head ach; but if naturally evacuated, they are ſoft, of a midle ſubſtance, brown colour, not of very offenſive ſmell, and correſponding with the quantity of things received.

humidity be not attracted by the reines, it cauſeth the cachexie, and dropſy. Inſenſible tranſpiration, if prohibited, cauſeth great diſeaſes, as pleurefies, peripneumonies, and putrid feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if according to nature, it preſerveth health. The ſperme unduely retained, cauſeth a heavineſſe of the whole body, and dangerous accidents if corrupted; if too much eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, it diſſipats natural heat, debilitats the whole body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulats crudities, hurts the nerves, and cauſeth the palſey, and debility of mind; the flux of the flowers ſhould be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, according to the temper and cuſtom of the woman, with certain intervals and periods: as for Venery it hurteth men more than women, if immoderate; and it's to be uſed chiefly in youth and at the middle age; But it hurts old men, and thoſe of a dry and weak conſtitution; when uſed, the interval muſt be ſuch, that the body may be lighter after than before; alſo it's worſt after hard drinking, ſtrong exerciſes, in time of famin, or after long evacuations. The <hi>Paſſions of the mind</hi> are no leſſe to be regarded; they if moderate, preſerving health; and decaying it, if immoderate, and therefore they are to be brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and as for the effects. Immoderate love doth accend, and often cauſeth palpitation, madneſſe, or fainting. Joy, if mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it recreats the heart and vital ſpirits; if ſuddain and exceſſive it ſo diſſipats the ſpirits, that often it cauſeth death. Sadneſſe doth by degrees diſſolve the ſpirits, cool and dry the body, hurt concoction, and cauſe watching, and melancholick diſeaſes, paleneſſe, and ſmalleneſſe of pulſe. Fear cals the heat inwards, makes cold, pale, weak, cauſeth looſeneſſe, reſolution of the muſcles, and ſometimes death with a ſmall pulſe. Anger moves the ſpirits outwards, agitats the ſame, and humours, beats, cauſeth feavers, trembling, abortion, and death. <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> alſo may be profitable, as Baths, which alter much; but often do not a little hurt thoſe that ſeldom uſe them, or that are cocochymick, plethorick, rheumatick and inclined to inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
<pb facs="tcp:170401:38"/>
and the eryſipelas. That of the vapour of ſweet water, heateth, at firſt relaxeth and moisteneth, after it melteth, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſweat; and if uſed long, it dryeth. Water hot, moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but first heateth; &amp; the hot vapours being gone, it cooleth, attenuats, and dryeth if tepid, cooleth the hot and heateth the cold, relaxeth, and impinguats moderately uſed, and concocts; uſed long, it diſſolves, and diſcuſſeth; therefore it's moderately to be uſed, by thoſe that are hot and ſlender, it helping them, as alſo the kectical, melancholick dry feavers, thirſty, weary, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and cutaneous affections: if cold, it refrigerats, binds, thickens, ſtrengthens, calls in heat, helps concoction, prevents external injuryes; but is bad for ſuch as uſe not a good diet or exerciſe, or are bound, or full of crudities, and ſharp vapours. The artificial vary, according to the ingredients; and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate according to their minerals; the ſulphureous heating, drying and reſolving; and the nitrous, dry and cleanſe. Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be uſed before or after bathing. Friction, if hard, hardens and thickens; and the contrary, if ſoft; the mean is indifferent; if much, it dſſolves and extenuats; if mean, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes fleſh; in the morning after evacuation of excrements, it helps the dry and weary; ſo in the evening, and helps the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie. As for Garments, they all heat; if of ſilk they heat more, and mollifie if fine, and heate more if villous; cloth heateth, and dryeth; that of skins if full of hair is warmeſt. Scarlet is hot, and draws forth the ſpirits; that which is aromatized is naught for a hot brain, and cauſeth head-ach; if linnen and flaxen, made white with lime, it biteth and cauſeth ſcabbineſſe; and that of hemp, is dryer.

Being given to children before meat, it hindreth corroſion. It helpeth the coeliack, and the dyſentery with hony. Being drunk it helps the teneſmus, ſo that of the cow.

Crabfiſhes being poudered and drunk in water, or the aſhes help againſt all poyſon, eſpecially againſt the wounds of Scorpions being taken in Aſſes milk, Goats, or any other, with wine. As alſo ruptures and convulſions. It white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſkin in women, (therefore it was uſed by <hi>Poppea,</hi> the wife of <hi>Domitius Nero</hi> for that purpoſe, who kept many Aſſes for that uſe,) it extending the ſkinn, making it tender and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrinkles. The <hi>urine</hi> of an Aſſe helps gallings by the ſhooe, the itch, and ſcabbed nailes. As alſo the leproſie and ſcales, or ſcurſe, about the riſing of the Dog ſtarre; ſo <hi>Plin.

A plaiſter thereof applyed to the forehead helpeth fluxions. <hi>Dioſc.</hi> Their dry dung when at graſſe, diſſolved in wine and drunk, helpeth againſt the bitings of the Scorpion. <hi>Plin.</hi> The aſhes of the dung drunk in wine helpe the coeliack, and thoſe troubled with the dyſentery. And if of one newly brought forth, being given with mulled vineger, it helps the vices of the ſpleen alſo. The decoction mightily helpeth the colon. The quantity of a bean being taken in wine helpeth the jaundiſe in three daies; ſo alſo that of a young colt. The aſhes of an Aſſes dung applied with

butter helpeth the eruptions of phlegme. The <hi>membrane</hi> of the yong, eſpecially if a male, being ſmelled to helpeth the falling ſickneſſe. <hi>Plin.</hi> The <hi>wild Aſſe</hi> T. is of worſe nouriſhment than the common. <hi>Gal.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> is like that of the hart, bull, or ſheep, cauſing an evil juyce, and being hardly concocted. <hi>Plin.</hi> V. The <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>bones,</hi> are more effectual againſt poyſons. The <hi>ſtone</hi> which ariſeth out of the urine when killed helpeth impoſtumes: The ſame being worne by women helps ſuppurations. The <hi>gall</hi> doth aſſwage the ſignes of abſceſſes, being applied: Alſo it is mixed with plaiſters againſt S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, which it is affirmed to cure, eſpecially it cureth the elephantiaſis, and varices: The <hi>fat</hi> with oile of coſtus, helpeth the paine of the reines and back, which are cauſed by thick humours: And the ſpots of the ſkinne. ſo <hi>Avic.</hi> The fleſh helpeth againſt the paine of the back bone, and hipps, ſo <hi>Rhaſ.

The <hi>dung</hi> mixed with the yolk of an egge, and applied to the forehead, ſtoppeth the fluxe of bloud, and with a Bulls gall curleth the hair. Being drunk when dry with wine it is very effectual againſt the hurt of Scorpions. <hi>Gal. Aldrovand.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> of Aſſes being eaten, doth infatuate, making the eater like, both in body and minde, all meats altering the temperature, and nature, and the manners naturally following the temperature of the body.

                  <p>COck, <hi>&amp;c. Aldrov. T.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> when young, is in a meane, betwixt that which doth attenuate and make thick; for it is eaſily concocted, begets laudable bloud, cauſeth a ſtomach, and is agreeable to all ſtomachs, eſpecially if fat, and before coiture; they then growing more dry, and ſaltiſh; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be gelded ſooner, they being then more cold, and of eaſier deſcent; yet not of much nouriſhment, or ſuch as will laſt long, conſiſting then of a thinne and fluxile bloud: therefore they are naught for ſuch as are troubled with the gout, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and received by the weaker parts. The <hi>braine</hi> is to be eaten with ſalt. The <hi>liver</hi> is moiſtiſh. The <hi>teſticles</hi> are eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. The <hi>eggs</hi> of Hens are <hi>beſt</hi> when freſh, and may be known by plenitude; they are beſt boiled, and when ſoftiſh. <hi>Gal.</hi> They then being light of digeſtion, of good juyce, not heating, but ſtrengthning, and clearing the throat: When hard, they are more groſſe, viſcous and ſtyptick. <hi>Muff.</hi> Young <hi>Cockrels,</hi> are the <hi>beſt</hi> of the chickens, which leave no excrements in the body; and therefore are uſed in burning feavers; it is of all fleſh the moſt commendable, nouriſhing much, cauſing ſperme and luſt. They are beſt roſted, being a moiſt meat; &amp; with ſorrel and ſugar, or with white wine vineger: They are a moſt temperate meat, for weake ſtomacks. The hardeſt of digeſtion are the white, ſo <hi>Gilbert, Griuener.</hi> Yet they are beſt for hectick perſons, being moſt cold and moiſt. They are beſt in ſummer, and Pullets and Hens in winter, the Cock-chickens are beſt before they crow lowd, &amp; the <hi>female</hi> before trodden: <hi>Cocks fleſh</hi> is <hi>beſt</hi> when young:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170401:117"/>
it helps conſumptions and hectick feavers. Their teſticles, livers, and loines, are of very good nouriſhment; if ſodden it's not good; the broth looſeneth, and the fleſh bindeth; which is contrary in that of a Hen, ſo <hi>Gal. C.</hi> thoſe are the <hi>beſt</hi> that are of the game under 2. yeares of age. As for <hi>Hens</hi> they are <hi>beſt</hi> before they have laid, and when full of egges; as alſo in <hi>January,</hi> and cold months, ſleep and reſt making them then fatteſt. When young the fleſh is very temperate, of good juyce, much nouriſhment, ſtrengthning naturall heate, engendring good bloud, ſharpning the appetite, quickning the eye ſight, nouriſhing the braine and ſperme, &amp; agreeing with all ages and complexions, turning whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the moſt part, into bloud, making a lively colour, and quickning all the ſenſes. <hi>Avic.</hi> The fleſh of <hi>Pullets</hi> helpeth the wit, cleareth the voice, and increaſeth the ſperme, ſo is of much nouriſhment. They are <hi>beſt</hi> when meanely fat, and fed with corne caſt into chaffe, that by exerciſe they may conſume their ſuperfluous moiſture. The fleſh of <hi>Capons</hi> of 7. or 8. months old, is preferred before all meats, by moſt Phyſicians. It helps the appetite, openeth the breaſt, cleareth the voice, fatteneth leane men, nouriſheth all men, reſtoreth ſickneſſes, hurteth none; but the idle, taſteth pleaſantly, and digeſteth eaſily; alſo it's more ſolid than that of pullets, more tender than that of Cocks, more agreeable than Pheaſants, or Partridges, not ſo dry as a Cock to be ſlowly digeſted, not ſo moiſt as a Chicken to be ſoone corrupted; but temperate, cauſing much in offenſive bloud, and much ſperme, without unnatural ſharpneſſe or heate: therefore <hi>Faventinus</hi> made it the <hi>baſis</hi> in his Analeptick Electuary, and <hi>Aloiſ. Mundella</hi> thinks that conſumption deſperate, which Capons gellies, and culliſes cannot recover. They are <hi>beſt</hi> roſted for moiſt ſtomacks; if boiled in white broth, they are of ſpeedier; but not ſtronger nouriſhment. The <hi>Italians</hi> make Hen-copenets, by ſering them in the loines. <hi>Note, Freitag.</hi> As for the name, it's called Capon, and <hi>Capo, quaſi caput omnium;</hi> or the chiefe of all other meats. As for <hi>egges,</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> are the Hens, the <hi>ſhell</hi> of which is like the earth, cold and dry; the <hi>white</hi> like water, cold, and moiſt; the <hi>froth</hi> therein like aire, hot and moiſt; the <hi>yolk</hi> like fire, hot and dry. Yet all together is temperate. The <hi>beſt</hi> are thoſe of Pullets engendred by the Cock new, white and long, ſuch nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing much, clearing the voice and breſt, ſtrengthning the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, curing conſumptions, &amp; cauſing luſt by nutrition. They nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh quickly being liquid fleſh, and much, by a proportionable heat
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170401:118"/>
and moiſture, they are beſt in the morning being neweſt, and in the Winter Hens being then fatteſt, and <hi>worst</hi> in Summer by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ill feeding: it is beſt to eate them alone, they otherwiſe corrupting, and filling the face with pimples and freckles. H. they are <hi>naught</hi> for Children, their hot bodies turning them into over hot nouriſhment, whence the itch, ſcabs, inflammations, and corruptions doe ariſe: alſo for old men, being hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in a cold ſtomach; they are <hi>beſt</hi> for temperate young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not feaveriſh. Egges ſerve alſo in fluxes, bridle ſharp and griping humours, reſtore ſpirits in the weakeneſſe of the heart, and ſpeedily paſſe from a cleane ſtomack. <hi>Note</hi> the longeſt are uſually <hi>Cock egges,</hi> ſo of beſt nouriſhment, alſo thoſe that have greateſt yolks nouriſh moſt; but the other are fitteſt for hot ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks. Furthermore <hi>rere egges</hi> are of lighteſt digeſtion, The <hi>hard</hi> of ſloweſt, and the <hi>ſoftiſh</hi> of ſtrongeſt nouriſhment. The <hi>fried</hi> are hot and maligne in quality: the <hi>potcht</hi> are beſt for hot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, or thoſe that are aguiſh. <hi>Sodden reere</hi> in the ſhell they are ſooneſt converted into bloud, and if <hi>roſted reere</hi> in the embers they make thickeſt and ſtrongeſt bloud, and are fitteſt for cold weake and wateriſh ſtomacks. <hi>Ficinus</hi> calleth them the quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fleſh. Finally, of all creatures, thoſe egges are moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that are moſt temperate, they being like their <hi>venters.</hi> They chiefely in <hi>uſe,</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Hens, Turkies, Peacocks, Pheaſants, Partridges, Berganders, Oſtriches, Ducks, Geeſe, Pigeons,</hi> and <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> As for the way of <hi>dreſsing</hi> them, it may be ſeene in <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Platina</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi> V. <hi>Hipp.</hi> The <hi>white of</hi> 3. <hi>egges</hi> being taken in water, helps the heate of feavers. <hi>Gal.</hi> The <hi>yolks</hi> help the ſyncopal feaver before the fourth day, uſing the <hi>fleſh</hi> after, chiefely that of a Capon, being more friable, and tender.
